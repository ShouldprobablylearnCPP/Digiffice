=== alpha-(pre-release) branch ===

This is the Alpha branch, where the next major version/update of Digiffice will be for the majority of its active development. When it is ready, the new version/update will be pushed into the beta branch, formally known as beta-(pre-release).

NOTE: Hotfixes and minor updates will not be developed in these branches. They will most likely have their own branch(es).
