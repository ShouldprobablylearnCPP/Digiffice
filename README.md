Digiffice is an open-source Office Program. It is currently pre-release, (in fact, very early development) but I would like to build some traction early. Here is why I am creating Digiffice and why it should be usable.

=== 1 - No/Minimal bloat ===
- Digiffice will have no bloatware, making it very undemanding and easy to use. I hope that the simplicity of the program will create a good user experience.

=== 2 - Free to use and run ===
- Digiffice's 1.0 release will be completely free and open source. It will also have 0 advertisements, so there is no chance of a 'catch'. No hidden paywalls, and every individual program that comes with it will be the exact same.

=== 3 - Personal Reasons ===
- As a solo developer, I am also creating Digiffice to refine my skills, learn new things, and overall become a better programmer and developer.

DISCLAIMERS:

=== 1 - Accounts are NOT secure as of the last update ===
- Until this project reaches a stable state, the account system will not be secure at this moment in time.

=== 2 - This is a long term project ===
- I will be supporting this project for a very long time, hopefully many years. However, it may also take quite a while to develop, as I am a solo developer with other projects alongside it.

=== 3 - The master branch is/will be the current release ===
- The master branch is the branch where the current release of Digiffice is. Currently, Digiffice is pre-release so the master branch will not contain a release version yet

=== 4 - Licensing ===
- While Digiffice is open-source, it is under the CC0 1.0 (Creative Commons 0) license.

WHAT TO EXPECT:

=== 1 - All in one application ===
A single copy of Digiffice will have all applications available - the list and names of these will be revealed at a later date.

=== 2 - Ease of use ===
One of the main advantages of Digiffice is that it will be very user friendly - the login process is simple, and the homepage will be easy to navigate - you can access your apps, settings and more from there.

=== 3 - Compatibility ===
While the list of supported Operating systems is not available yet, it will be compatible with many, even some legacy ones. While it won't be compatible with everything, I am aiming for at least 90% of PCs to be able to run it.
