Digiffice is an open-source Office Program. It is currently pre-release, (in fact, very early development) but I would like to build some traction. Here is why I am creating Digiffice and why it should be usable.

=== 1 - No/Minimal bloat ===
- Digiffice will have no bloatware, making it very undemanding and easy to use. I hope that the simplicity of the program will create a good user experience.

=== 2 - Free to use and run ===
- Digiffice's 1.0 release will be completely free and open source. It will also have 0 advertisements, so there is no chance of a 'catch'. No hidden paywalls, and every individual program that comes with it will be the exact same.

=== 3 - Personal Reasons ===
- As a solo developer, I am also creating Digiffice to refine my skills, learn new things, and overall become a better programmer and developer.

DISCLAIMERS:

=== 1 - Accounts are NOT secure as of the last update ===
- Until this project reaches a stable state, the account system will not be secure at this moment in time.

=== 2 - This is a long term project ===
- I will be supporting this project for a very long time, hopefully many years. However, it may also take quite a while to develop, as I am a solo developer with other projects alongside it.

CONCLUSION:

If you have made it to this point so far, thank you for reading this. Feel free to check out the project and explore this project of mine :)
